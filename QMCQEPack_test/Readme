In this folder there are two tests for the QMCQEPack interface, each consisting in a simulation
run for a simple physical system: four hydrogen atom in a square and an oxygen atom.
In each folder there are the input files required to run a simulation, and a reference folder
with reference outputs.
In both cases we firstly run a DFT simulation with Quantum Espresso (using a PBE and a LSDA functional
for the hydrogen and oxygen cases respectively), then we generate the single particle orbitals and
we use them in a Variational Monte Carlo simulation.

In both cases to run the test one must go in the relevant folder and run

PATH_TO_QMCPACK_BUILD/bin/qmcpack test_X.input.xml > output file

and compare the resulting files with the content of the Reference folder.

It is especially important to compare the final energy of the DFT computation, referred as

!    total energy              =       xxxxxxxxxx Ry

in the output file and the QMC estimators in the test_X.s000.scalar.dat.
