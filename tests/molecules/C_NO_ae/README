This integration test tests numerical Hartree-Fock orbitals generated 
with the SQD code (packaged with QMCPACK) for a carbon atom with spin 
multiplicity 3 (4 up, 2 down electrons).  A test of this type has been 
used with QMCPACK since 2007.


SQD orbitals and reference data
===============================
Orbitals were generated using SVN revision 6259 of SQD.  The 
corresponding inputs and outputs of the SQD code can be found in 
./sqd-ref.  The orbital file itself, C.s000.h5, has been moved 
to the test directory (./).  Reference total, kinetic, and potential 
Hartree-Fock energies are available in the log output from SQD 
(C.s000.log):

Energy =    -37.68858615  Ha
KE     =     37.68859387  Ha
PE     =    -75.37718002  Ha


Test details
============
The tests include short and long VMC and DMC runs for the C atom: 
1) Slater-only VMC (Hartree-Fock), 2) Slater-Jastrow VMC, 3) 
Slater-Jastrow DMC (timestep = 0.01/Ha).  A previously optimized 
two-body Jastrow factor (J1 B-spline, J2 Pade) was used in the 
Slater-Jastrow runs. Reference data for the tests was produced with 
QMCPACK SVN revision 6259.  QMCPACK versions 3.1.1, 3.2.0, and 3.3.0 
were confirmed to produce correct results.

Reference data was generated with runs the same overall length 
(blocks x steps) as those included in ./qmc-ref, but using more blocks 
and fewer steps.  Using more blocks reduced the statistical error of 
the error bars, but resulted in output data files that were too large 
to include in the QMCPACK distribution.  The reference values and error 
bars were therefore computed from the higher block count runs.  The 
included reference runs were confirmed to be consistent with the original 
higher block count runs.

Reference data from the high block count runs is found below:

                   LocalEnergy             Variance               ratio 
C.NO_HF series 0  -37.688652 +/- 0.000237  8.201219 +/- 0.340898  0.2176 
 
C.NO_J2 series 0  -37.769812 +/- 0.000106  0.632539 +/- 0.000181  0.0167 
C.NO_J2 series 1  -37.828154 +/- 0.000501  0.623047 +/- 0.000380  0.0165 
C.NO_J2 series 2  -37.828225 +/- 0.000087  0.622712 +/- 0.000084  0.0165 

For comparison, corresponding data for the lower block count reference 
data found in ./qmc-ref is:

>qmca -e 2 -q ev *scalar*
                   LocalEnergy             Variance               ratio

C.NO_J2 series 0  -37.769753 +/- 0.000102  0.632514 +/- 0.000160  0.0167 
C.NO_J2 series 1  -37.828061 +/- 0.000984  0.623063 +/- 0.000498  0.0165 
C.NO_J2 series 2  -37.828204 +/- 0.000090  0.622607 +/- 0.000094  0.0165 

Test input files were created by reducing the number of steps from the 
included reference by a factor of 10 for the "long" tests and by a 
further factor of 10 for the "short" tests.

Reference values for the mean local energy and variance were taken 
from the high block count reference runs.  Expected error bars were 
derived from the high block count data by multiplying the reference 
error bars by a factor of sqrt(10+1) and sqrt(100+1) for the long 
and short tests, respectively.  The factor of +1 accounts for the 
error bar intrinsic to the high block count runs.  This factor was 
set to zero for the direct Hartree-Fock comparison since the error 
bar is formally zero for the SQD reference values.

The target means and error bars for long and short tests are:

                 refmean     referr    longerr   shorterr
VMC HF energy   -37.68858615 0.000237  0.000749  0.002370
VMC J2 energy   -37.769812   0.000106  0.000352  0.001065
       variance   0.632539   0.000181  0.000600  0.001819    
DMC J2 energy   -37.828225   0.000087  0.000289  0.000874
       variance   0.622712   0.000084  0.000279  0.000844

In the above, the reference energy from SQD has been used as the reference 
value, while all other quantities were taken from the high block count 
QMCPACK runs.         

Error bars from typical long and short runs are shown below:
